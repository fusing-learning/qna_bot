Analysis: Current Implementation vs Duplicate Filenames

  Current Status: ✅ PARTIALLY HANDLES CONFLICTS

  What works well:
  1. ✅ Filesystem conflicts: Solved with UUID filenames
  2. ✅ Database storage: Allows multiple files with same original_filename
  3. ✅ Basic functionality: Upload and processing works fine

  Potential issue:
  ⚠️ Source citation ambiguity: If two files have the same original_filename (e.g., two different "Policy.md" files), the citations would both show "Policy.md" without any way to distinguish
  them.

  Example problematic scenario:
  - User uploads Policy.md (version 1)
  - Later uploads another Policy.md (version 2, different content)
  - When asking questions, citations show "Policy.md" but user can't tell which version

  Recommendations for improvement:

  1. Add document ID or timestamp to citations when duplicates exist
  2. Enhance citation format to include additional context
  3. Implement versioning in citation display

  Current implementation is adequate for most use cases, but could be improved for better UX with duplicate filenames.
